                            <p>Welcome to ElAbed Poultry, Egypt's Leading Duck and Quail provider with a rich history rooted
                                in family values and a commitment to delivering the highest quality poultry products.
                                Founded in 1985 by Mr. Abed Ramsis, our company has steadily grown from a small, humble farm
                                into a thriving enterprise with over 40 farms spread across Egypt.</p>

                            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                            <p>At El Abed Poultry, our mission is clear: to be Egypt's poultry leader by consistently
                                delivering the highest quality products to our customers. We are committed to raising
                                cage-free, hormone-free, and antibiotic-free birds, ensuring their well-being and the
                                production of wholesome poultry. Our dedication extends beyond the farm, as we carefully
                                select the finest corn and soy to create a 100% vegetarian diet for our birds. We take pride
                                in our quality assurance process, which includes slaughtering the birds under Islamic ritual
                                at our own abattoir, and utilizing state-of-the-art commercial freezers to freeze the
                                processed birds at -40Â°C. With every step we take, our mission is to provide exceptional
                                poultry that meets the highest standards of quality, integrity, and customer satisfaction.
